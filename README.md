Let's face it, syntax highlighting is boring. Why worry about syntax and
diagnostics when you can worry about issues that don't even exist? Introducing:
**Syntax Gaslighting**. Informs you about very real issues in your code (source:
trust me) in real time, making you think twice before you commit another
atrocity to production.

## Usage

_Use what?_

Install with your favorite package manager (or Nix), then call the `setup`
function. Available configuration options, and configuration recipes are
documented below.

```lua
require("syntax-gaslighting").setup()
```

## Example Configuration

```lua
require("syntax-gaslighting").setup({
    -- Set the chance of gaslighting per line (1-100%)
    gaslighting_chance = 5, -- Default is 5%

    -- Minimum line length to apply gaslighting
    min_line_length = 10, -- Default is 10 characters

    -- Custom messages for gaslighting (optional)
    messages = {
        "Are you sure this will pass the code quality checks? ü§î",
        "Is this line really covered by unit tests? üßê",
        -- Add more custom messages here...
    },

    -- Option to merge user messages with the default ones (default: false)
    -- If disabled, the messages table will override default messages.
    merge_messages = true,

    -- Highlight group for gaslighting messages (linked to 'Comment' by default)
    highlight = "GaslightingUnderline",

    -- Debounce delay for updates in milliseconds (default: 500ms)
    debounce_delay = 500,

    -- Auto-update on buffer events (default: true)
    auto_update = true,

    -- List of filetypes to ignore (default: {"netrw"})
    filetypes_to_ignore = { "netrw", "markdown" },
})
```

## Better Inline Messages

By default we use the `Comment` highlight group for gaslighting. You may wish to
use a different color, e.g., to resemble diagnostic messages. In which case you
may define a higlight group, which by default should be named
`GaslightingUnderline`, with your own desired properties.

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_hl(0, "GaslightingUnderline", { fg = "#DCDCAA", bold = true })
require('syntax-gaslighting').setup({})
```

The name of this group can be customized by setting `config.highlight` to the
name of your desired highlight group. This should be useful to integrate with
your favorite theme plugins.
